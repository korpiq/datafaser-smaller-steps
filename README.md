# Datafaser

Attempt to create a data filtering language without rabbit holes.

Final goal is to create a programming language that is structured around filtering and transforming data instead of generic programming, in order to avoid focusing on coding instead of the data.

Midterm goal is to represent programs in this language as data it can efficiently handle itself, so it can be used to transpile itself.

Initial goal is to just define clear structure for the data filtering and transformations.
